Asifur Rahman

Graduate of the first ever, fully remote Makers Academy.

After graduating from Bristol University, I was not sure what to do with my English degree. After a hapless run of near successes in advertising, I entered retail, 
working at Marks and Spencers in the Royal Free Hospital, as well as my parents, running a newsagents; whilst this gave me an eye and ear for all walks of life, I found myself unfulfilled, and decided to stoke both my love of learning and creativity by taking up coding.

Hobbies

A vast reader, I love to read. My favourite writers include Bret Easton Ellis, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Ivan Solzhenitsyn, Mikhail Bulgakov,
Franz Kafka, Virginia Woolf, Evelyn Waugh, Kurt Vonnegut, Charles Bukowski and Haruki Murakami. In my spare time, I love to write, and help as an editor on reddit's r/writing. 

I love watching foreign and independent cinema, particularly East Asian cinema (whether it's some violent fun like John Woo or The Shaw Brothers to more thoughtful films by Yatsujiro Ozu and Wong Kar Wai). I love learning about the world through films and documentaries.

My varied interests definitely keep me curious about the world, and I try to maintain programming amongst them, so that it feels fun and thus motivating.
