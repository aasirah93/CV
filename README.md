Asifur Rahman

Graduate of the first ever, fully remote Makers Academy.

After graduating from Bristol University, I was not sure what to do with my English degree. I entered retail, having grown up with it,
working at Marks and Spencers in the Royal Free Hospital, as well as with my parents running a newsagents; whilst this gave me an eye and ear for all walks of life, I found myself unfulfilled, and decided to stoke both my love of learning and creativity by taking up coding.

Hobbies:

A vast reader, I love to read. My favourite writers include Bret Easton Ellis, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Kurt Vonnegut, Franz Kafra, Chinua Achebe, EM Forster, Haruki Murakami and Virginia Woolf. 
In my spare time, I love to write, and help as an editor on reddit's r/writing. 

I love watching foreign and independent cinema, particularly East Asian cinema (whether it's some violent fun like John Woo or The Shaw Brothers to more thoughtful films by Yatsujiro Ozu and Wong Kar Wai). I love learning about the world through films and documentaries.

I am also a keen boxing fan.  

My varied interests definitely keep me curious about the world, and I try to maintain programming amongst them, so that it feels fun and thus motivating. I would travel more, if I could afford it, and hopefully when the world overcomes this thing we are in, I will.
