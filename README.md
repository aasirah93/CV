Asifur Rahman

Graduate of the first ever, fully remote Makers Academy.

After graduating from Bristol University, I was not sure what to do with my English degree. After a hapless run of near successes in advertising, I entered retail, 
working at Marks and Spencers in the Royal Free Hospital, as well as my parents, running a newsagents; whilst this gave me an eye and ear for all walks of life, I found myself unfulfilled, and decided to stoke both my love of learning and creativity by taking up coding.

Hobbies

A vast reader, I love to read. My hobbies include writing, watching foreign and independent cinema, as well as martial arts, including Jiu Jitsu and Boxing. I love travel and would love to travel more. I would love to combine my English degree and a future deeper skill in programming and return to Bangladesh one day and help children with both coding and English.
I also really enjoy keeping up with videogames, particularly console ones (I appreciate that PC is the superior machine), which cultivated my interest in programming and coding, my quarantine favourites being Devil May Cry, Spiderman and The Witcher 3.
My varied interests definitely keep me curious about the world, and I try to maintain programming amongst them, so that it feels fun and thus motivating.
